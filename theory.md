# 1. [Big O Notation](#00)

Big O notation is a method or tool to describe time (runtime) and space (memory) complexity of an algorithm in terms of its inputs.
- The asymptotic behavior of an algorithm is estimated by looking at the Big O of an algo
- Can be used for comparative analysis of different algos
- Provides a prediction of the upper limit of the runtime or memory, in a worst-case scenario, helping in optimizing code for scalability, performance and efficiency
- Can be critical for ML enginners and practiotioners to choose the appropriate learning algorithms, depending on resource constraints and business questions 

**Shortcut to find the Big O of a function:** Look for the highest order of the variables.

For example, 
1. If f(x) =  3x^3+2x^2+12, O(f(x)) -> x^3
2. If f(n) = 3n+2n^0.5, O(f(n)) -> n
```
