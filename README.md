# DSA Implementations and Applications in Python

This project contains my implementations and applications of DSA in Python language. This is intended to document my learning process and applications of Data Structures and Algorithms for popular use-cases and interview questions.

## Item List
1. [Big O Notation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/)
2. Time complexity analysis
3. Data Structures
>- Stacks
>- Queues
>- Linked Lists
>- Trees
>- ...skipping more complex data structures and implementations
4. Sorting & Searching algorithms (implementation not necessary, but have a basic understanding re Items 1 & 2)
5. Graph algos
6. Some niche algo, theory only (Dynamic Programming, greedy algos, 2-pointer approach, sliding window)

## My Goals
100 Questions - LeetCode, HackerRank, TechDevGuide, NeetCode, AlgoExpert

## My Strategy
**Stage 1:**
1. Gain an understanding of Big O Notation
2. Understand Time Complexity Analysis fundamentals
3. Fail-fast, watch answers, re-do questions
4. Improve my approach (eg: Unsolved -> O(n^2)-> O(n) -> O(n))

**Stage 2:**
1. Simulate a real coding interview by recording yourself and answering questions
2. Watch and participate in mock interviews - work on presentation, approach and problem breakdown (10-15)
3. Learn to walk while running
